## Overview & Core Requirements

We want to build a **Twitter-like news feed platform** where users can:

1. **Post short messages/tweets** (text, images, videos, links).
2. **Follow other users** to see their posts in a personalized timeline.
3. **Read their home timeline** consisting of posts from users they follow.
4. **Like, retweet, and reply** to posts.
5. **Search** for posts and users.
6. Receive **notifications** for interactions.
7. Discover **trending topics and hashtags**.
8. View a **user profile** with their posts and activity.

### Additional Requirements

- **High availability** and **low latency** for read operations (timeline viewing).
- **Eventual consistency** is acceptable, but feeds should feel "real-time".
- **Highly scalable** to support millions of users and billions of tweets.
- **Real-time updates** to timelines (within seconds of a new post).
- **Content delivery optimization** for media (images, videos).
- **Search functionality** for posts and users.
- **Analytics** for user engagement and trending content.
- **Content moderation** to filter inappropriate content.
- **Global distribution** of users across different regions.

- **Notes**: 
  - Posts contain metadata like author ID, timestamp, media references, reply status.
  - Publishes events about new posts to Kafka for downstream processing.
  - Must handle high write volume during peak events or viral content.

### Timeline Service
- **Responsibilities**: Builds and serves user home timelines, user profiles timelines, and aggregated feeds.
- **Data Store**:
  - Redis for caching active user timelines (list of post IDs).
  - NoSQL (Cassandra) for persistent timeline storage.
- **Notes**:
  - Consumes "PostCreated" events from Kafka.
  - Implements fan-out strategies (push vs. pull model).
  - Special handling for high-follower accounts ("celebrities").
  - Maintains timeline ranking algorithms (chronological or engagement-based).

### Social Graph Service
- **Responsibilities**: Manages follow relationships between users.
- **Data Store**: 
  - Graph database (Neo4j) or sharded relational DB (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
  - Redis for caching frequently accessed follower/following lists.
- **Notes**:
  - Highly optimized for querying "who follows X" and "who does X follow".
  - Handles follow/unfollow events and publishes to Kafka.
  - Provides APIs for friend recommendations and graph traversal.

### User Service

  - Provides dashboards for business insights.

### Trending Service
- **Responsibilities**: Identifies trending topics, hashtags, and posts in real-time.
- **Data Flow**: 
  - Consumes events from Kafka for post creation and engagement.
  - Utilizes stream processing (Flink/Spark Streaming) for trend detection.
- **Notes**:
  - Implements algorithms to detect sudden spikes in topic popularity.
  - Considers recency, volume, and acceleration of activity.
  - May segment trends by region, topic, or user demographic.

### Content Moderation Service
- **Responsibilities**: Filters and flags inappropriate content.
- **Data Flow**: 
  - Consumes post events from Kafka.
  - Uses ML models to detect policy violations.
- **Notes**:
  - Combines automated filtering with human moderation queues.
  - Handles user reports and content takedowns.
  - Must operate with low latency to prevent harmful content propagation.

## High-Level Architecture & Data Flow

1. **Post Creation Flow**
   - User creates post via **Client App**.
   - **Post Service** stores post in Cassandra and publishes "PostCreated" event to Kafka.
   - **Multiple consumers** process this event:
     - **Timeline Service** updates followers' timelines (fan-out).
     - **Search Service** indexes the post content.
     - **Media Service** processes any attached media.
     - **Moderation Service** scans content for policy violations.

2. **Timeline Reading Flow**
   - User requests home timeline from **Client App**.
   - Request goes to **Timeline Service**.
   - Service checks Redis cache for user's timeline.
   - If cache miss, rebuilds timeline from persistent storage.
   - Returns list of post IDs.
   - **Client App** fetches post details in batches or via CDN.

3. **Follow/Unfollow Flow**
   - **Social Graph Service** updates follow relationship.
   - Publishes "FollowCreated" or "FollowRemoved" event to Kafka.
   - **Timeline Service** may backfill timeline with recent posts from new followee.

4. **Engagement Flow (Like/Retweet/Reply)**
   - User engagement is sent to respective services.
   - Events are published to Kafka.
   - **Notification Service** consumes events to alert relevant users.
   - **Analytics Service** tracks engagement metrics.
   - **Trending Service** uses engagement signals for trend detection.

5. **Search Flow**
   - User query sent to **Search Service**.
   - Elasticsearch returns relevant posts/users.
   - Results may be filtered by permissions, language, or recency.

## Key System Design Topics & Deep Dives

### Push vs Pull Model (Fan-out on Write vs Fan-out on Read)

**Concept & Principles**
- **Fan-out on Write (Push model)**: When a post is created, it's immediately copied to all followers' timelines.
- **Fan-out on Read (Pull model)**: When a user requests their timeline, the system dynamically queries and aggregates posts from all followed users.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both strategies based on user characteristics.

**Real-World Usage**
- Twitter uses a hybrid approach: push model for most users, pull model for celebrities with millions of followers.
- Instagram similarly uses push by default but handles celebrities differently.

**Java Example (Timeline Service - Hybrid Fan-out)**

```java
@Service
public class TimelineService {

    @Autowired
    private SocialGraphService socialGraphService;
    
    @Autowired
    private PostRepository postRepository;
    
    @Autowired
    private TimelineRepository timelineRepository;
    
    @Autowired
    private RedisTemplate<String, List<String>> redisTemplate;
    
    @KafkaListener(topics = "post-created")
    public void processNewPost(PostCreatedEvent event) {
        Post post = event.getPost();
        
        // Get author's followers
        List<Long> followers = socialGraphService.getFollowers(post.getUserId());
        
        // Check if this is a "celebrity" post (high follower count)
        if (followers.size() > CELEBRITY_THRESHOLD) {
            // For celebrities, store post without fan-out
            // It will be pulled when followers request their timeline
            markPostAsFromCelebrity(post.getId());
            return;
        }
        
        // For regular users, push to all followers' timelines
        for (Long followerId : followers) {
            // Skip inactive users to save resources
            if (!isActiveUser(followerId)) continue;
            
            // Add to follower's timeline in DB
            timelineRepository.addPostToTimeline(followerId, post.getId());
            
            // Update cache if it exists
            String timelineKey = "timeline:" + followerId;
            if (redisTemplate.hasKey(timelineKey)) {
                redisTemplate.opsForList().leftPush(timelineKey, post.getId().toString());
                redisTemplate.opsForList().trim(timelineKey, 0, MAX_TIMELINE_SIZE - 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    public List<Post> getUserTimeline(Long userId, int pageSize, String cursor) {
        // Try to get from cache first
        String timelineKey = "timeline:" + userId;
        List<String> postIds = redisTemplate.opsForValue().get(timelineKey);
        
        // Cache miss - rebuild from DB
        if (postIds == null) {
            // Get regular posts from timeline
            postIds = timelineRepository.getTimelinePostIds(userId, pageSize, cursor);
            
            // Merge with celebrity posts (pull model)
            List<Long> followedCelebrities = socialGraphService.getFollowedCelebritiesIds(userId);
            List<String> celebPostIds = postRepository.getRecentPostIdsFromUsers(
                followedCelebrities, 
                getLastTimelineTimestamp(postIds)
            );
            
            // Merge and sort both lists
            postIds.addAll(celebPostIds);
            sortByTimestamp(postIds);
            
            // Cache the result
            redisTemplate.opsForValue().set(timelineKey, postIds, CACHE_TTL);
        }
        
        // Fetch and return actual post data
        return postRepository.findPostsByIds(postIds);
    }
}
```

**Performance & Scaling**
- Push model: O(n) writes for n followers, but O(1) reads.
- Pull model: O(1) writes, but O(m) reads for m followees.
- Push model favors read-heavy workloads (Twitter's case).
- Hybrid approach balances both scenarios.

**Pitfalls & Best Practices**
- **Hot-User Problem**: Celebrity posts cause write amplification.
- **Feed Inconsistency**: Pull model may miss posts if a user follows many people.
- **Resource Waste**: Pushing to inactive users wastes resources.
- Use a configurable threshold to determine push vs. pull approach.
- Limit home timeline size in storage to prevent unbounded growth.
- Skip updates for long-inactive users; rebuild on demand when they return.

### Caching Strategies

**Concept & Principles**
- Multi-level caching to reduce latency and database load.
- Different cache types for different data access patterns.
- Time-to-live (TTL) policies to manage staleness.

**Real-World Usage**
- **Timeline Cache**: Recent home timeline for active users.
- **Post Cache**: Frequently accessed posts (viral content).
- **User Graph Cache**: Follow relationships for active users.
- **Counting Cache**: Engagement counters (likes, retweets).

**Java Example (Redis Caching for Timeline)**

```java
@Configuration
public class RedisCacheConfig {
    @Bean
    public RedisTemplate<String, List<String>> redisTemplate(
            RedisConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
        RedisTemplate<String, List<String>> template = new RedisTemplate<>();
        template.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory);
        // Configure serializers
        return template;
    }
}

@Service
public class TimelineCacheService {
    
    @Autowired
    private RedisTemplate<String, List<String>> redisTemplate;
    
    private static final int MAX_TIMELINE_SIZE = 800; // Store latest ~800 posts
    private static final int ACTIVE_USER_TTL = 3600; // 1 hour in seconds
    
    public void cacheUserTimeline(Long userId, List<String> postIds) {
        String key = "timeline:" + userId;
        redisTemplate.opsForValue().set(key, postIds);
        redisTemplate.expire(key, ACTIVE_USER_TTL, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    }
    
    public List<String> getCachedTimeline(Long userId) {
        String key = "timeline:" + userId;
        return redisTemplate.opsForValue().get(key);
    }
    
    public void addPostToTimelines(List<Long> userIds, String postId) {
        for (Long userId : userIds) {
            String key = "timeline:" + userId;
            if (redisTemplate.hasKey(key)) {
                // Add to the beginning of the list (newest first)
                List<String> timeline = redisTemplate.opsForValue().get(key);
                timeline.add(0, postId);
                // Trim to keep only the most recent posts
                if (timeline.size() > MAX_TIMELINE_SIZE) {
                    timeline = timeline.subList(0, MAX_TIMELINE_SIZE);
                }
                redisTemplate.opsForValue().set(key, timeline);
                // Reset TTL on write
                redisTemplate.expire(key, ACTIVE_USER_TTL, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void removeCachedTimeline(Long userId) {
        String key = "timeline:" + userId;
        redisTemplate.delete(key);
    }
}
```

**Performance & Scaling**
- In-memory caching reduces read latency by 10-100x compared to disk.
- Read-through and write-through caching ensures consistency.
- Redis Cluster enables horizontal scaling of cache capacity.
- Replicas provide high availability and read scaling.

**Pitfalls & Best Practices**
- **Cache Invalidation**: One of the hardest problems; use TTL as safety.
- **Cache Stampede**: Many concurrent requests for uncached data; use request coalescing.
- **Memory Pressure**: Over-caching can cause evictions; monitor cache hit rates.
- Use intelligent TTL based on data volatility and access patterns.
- Implement cache warming for predictable high-traffic events.
- Consider write-behind caching for engagement counters to reduce DB writes.

### Database Design & Storage

**Concept & Principles**
- Polyglot persistence: Different databases for different data types and access patterns.
- Sharding strategies for horizontal scaling.
- Replication for high availability and read scaling.

**Real-World Usage**
- **Posts/Tweets**: NoSQL (Cassandra) for high write throughput.
- **User Data**: Relational DB (PostgreSQL) for ACID properties.
- **Social Graph**: Graph database (Neo4j) or sharded relational DB.
- **Timelines**: NoSQL (Cassandra) for write scalability and time-ordered access.

**Database Schema Examples**

```sql
-- Relational DB schema for User Service (PostgreSQL)
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    display_name VARCHAR(100),
    bio TEXT,
    profile_image_url VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

-- Social Graph relationships (PostgreSQL approach)
CREATE TABLE follows (
    follower_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    followee_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (follower_id, followee_id)
);
CREATE INDEX ON follows(followee_id); -- For finding followers efficiently
```

**NoSQL Schema (Cassandra CQL)**

```sql
-- Posts table in Cassandra
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT,
    content TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    is_reply BOOLEAN,
    reply_to_id UUID,
    media_urls LIST<TEXT>,
    hashtags SET<TEXT>,
    mentioned_users SET<BIGINT>
);

-- Home timeline table (denormalized for fast reads)
CREATE TABLE user_timelines (
    user_id BIGINT,
    post_id UUID,
    post_time TIMESTAMP,
    post_user_id BIGINT,
    is_retweet BOOLEAN,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, post_time, post_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (post_time DESC);

-- User posts timeline (for profile views)
CREATE TABLE user_posts (
    user_id BIGINT,
    post_id UUID,
    post_time TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, post_time, post_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (post_time DESC);
```

**Performance & Scaling**
- Horizontal sharding by user ID distributes load across database nodes.
- Denormalization optimizes for read patterns (storing post_user_id in timeline table).
- Time-based partitioning for older data archival.
- Read replicas to scale query capacity.

**Pitfalls & Best Practices**
- **Hotspots**: Shard keys must distribute evenly to avoid overloaded partitions.
- **Join Complexity**: NoSQL databases often require denormalization to avoid joins.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Timeline inconsistencies can confuse users; UI should handle gracefully.
- Choose appropriate consistency levels for different operations.
- Plan for database expansion from day one (architecture that handles resharding).
- Implement data modeling that optimizes for the most common query patterns.

### Distributed System Patterns

**Concept & Principles**
- **Event Sourcing**: Storing all changes as a sequence of events.
- **CQRS**: Separating read and write models/operations.
- **Saga Pattern**: Managing distributed transactions.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Preventing cascading failures when services fail.

**Real-World Usage**
- Twitter's fan-out model is a form of CQRS (write to Post Service, read from Timeline Service).
- Event sourcing for tracking all post interactions, enabling accurate analytics.
- Circuit breakers between critical service dependencies (e.g., Post → Social Graph).

**Java Example (Circuit Breaker with Resilience4j)**

```java
@Service
public class TimelineService {
    
    private final SocialGraphService socialGraphService;
    private final CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker;
    
    public TimelineService(SocialGraphService socialGraphService) {
        this.socialGraphService = socialGraphService;
        
        // Configure circuit breaker
        CircuitBreakerConfig config = CircuitBreakerConfig.custom()
            .failureRateThreshold(50)
            .waitDurationInOpenState(Duration.ofMillis(1000))
            .permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState(2)
            .slidingWindowSize(10)
            .build();
            
        this.circuitBreaker = CircuitBreaker.of("socialGraphService", config);
    }
    
    public List<Long> getFollowers(Long userId) {
        return circuitBreaker.executeSupplier(() -> {
            return socialGraphService.getFollowers(userId);
        });
    }
    
    // Fallback method when circuit is open
    private List<Long> getFollowersFallback(Long userId, Exception e) {
        // Log the failure
        log.error("Failed to get followers for user {}: {}", userId, e.getMessage());
        
        // Return cached version if available or empty list
        return getCachedFollowersOrEmpty(userId);
    }
}
```

**Performance & Scaling**
- Asynchronous event processing decouples services and improves throughput.
- CQRS allows independent scaling of read and write paths.
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures during partial outages.

**Pitfalls & Best Practices**
- **Eventual Consistency**: Events may be processed out of order; use logical timestamps.
- **Event Replay**: Design systems to handle duplicate events (idempotence).
- **Service Boundaries**: Unclear domain boundaries cause complexity or tight coupling.
- Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
- Use correlation IDs across service boundaries for tracing.
- Design for graceful degradation under partial system failures.

### Security Fundamentals

**Concept & Principles**
- Authentication and authorization.
- Data privacy and protection.
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention.
- Secure data transmission (TLS/HTTPS).

**Real-World Usage**
- OAuth 2.0 with JWT for user authentication.
- Fine-grained permissions for post visibility (public, followers-only, private).
- Rate limiting to prevent scraping and DoS attacks.

**Java Example (Spring Security with JWT)**

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private JwtTokenProvider jwtTokenProvider;

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .csrf().disable()
            .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)
            .and()
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/api/auth/**").permitAll()
            .antMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/api/posts/public/**").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .apply(new JwtConfigurer(jwtTokenProvider));
    }
}

@Service
public class JwtTokenProvider {
    
    @Value("${jwt.secret}")
    private String secretKey;
    
    @Value("${jwt.expiration}")
    private long validityInMilliseconds;
    
    @PostConstruct
    protected void init() {
        secretKey = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(secretKey.getBytes());
    }
    
    public String createToken(String username, List<String> roles) {
        Claims claims = Jwts.claims().setSubject(username);
        claims.put("roles", roles);
        
        Date now = new Date();
        Date validity = new Date(now.getTime() + validityInMilliseconds);
        
        return Jwts.builder()
            .setClaims(claims)
            .setIssuedAt(now)
            .setExpiration(validity)
            .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, secretKey)
            .compact();
    }
    
    // Additional methods for token validation, user extraction, etc.
}
```

**Performance & Scaling**
- JWT tokens reduce database lookups for authentication.
- Distributed rate limiting via Redis for consistent enforcement across API gateways.
- CDN caching for public content reduces origin server load.

**Pitfalls & Best Practices**
- **Token Theft**: Store tokens securely, implement refresh token rotation.
- **Overprivileged Access**: Implement principle of least privilege for service accounts.
- **Rate Limit Bypass**: Use multiple dimensions for rate limiting (IP, user ID, endpoint).
- Implement proper input validation to prevent injection attacks.
- Run regular security audits and penetration tests.
- Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities.

### Microservices Architecture

**Concept & Principles**
- Service boundaries based on business domains.
- Independent deployment and scaling.
- API gateway for client requests.
- Service discovery and load balancing.

**Real-World Usage**
- Separate services for posts, timeline, social graph, etc.
- Each service has its own database/cache.
- Spring Boot for service implementation.
- Kubernetes for container orchestration.

**Java Example (Spring Boot Microservice)**

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
public class PostServiceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(PostServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/posts")
public class PostController {

    @Autowired
    private PostService postService;
    
    @PostMapping
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
    public PostResponse createPost(@RequestBody @Valid CreatePostRequest request,
                                  @AuthenticationPrincipal UserDetails userDetails) {
        return postService.createPost(request, userDetails.getUsername());
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/{postId}")
    public PostResponse getPost(@PathVariable String postId) {
        return postService.getPost(postId);
    }
    
    // Additional endpoints
}
```

**Performance & Scaling**
- Independent horizontal scaling based on service load.
- Kubernetes auto-scaling for dynamic workloads.
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates.

**Pitfalls & Best Practices**
- **Service Proliferation**: Too many microservices increase operational complexity.
- **Distributed Debugging**: Difficult to trace requests across services.
- **API Versioning**: Breaking changes can affect multiple services.
- Use distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin) for request visualization.
- Implement health checks and circuit breakers for resilience.
- Standardize API design with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.

### Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka)

**Concept & Principles**
- Asynchronous communication between services via events.
- Decoupling producers and consumers.
- Event sourcing and replay capabilities.
- Scalable stream processing.

**Real-World Usage**
- Post creation publishes events for fan-out, search indexing, and analytics.
- Follow/unfollow events trigger timeline updates.
- Engagement events (likes, retweets) update counters and trigger notifications.

**Java Example (Kafka Producer & Consumer)**

```java
@Service
public class PostEventProducer {

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, PostEvent> kafkaTemplate;
    
    @Value("${kafka.topic.post-created}")
    private String postCreatedTopic;
    
    public void publishPostCreatedEvent(Post post) {
        PostEvent event = new PostEvent(
            post.getId(),
            post.getUserId(),
            post.getContent(),
            post.getCreatedAt(),
            PostEventType.CREATED
        );
        
        // Partition by user ID for ordered processing of user's posts
        kafkaTemplate.send(postCreatedTopic, post.getUserId().toString(), event);
        log.info("Published post created event: {}", event);
    }
}

@Service
public class TimelineUpdateConsumer {

    @Autowired
    private TimelineService timelineService;
    
    @KafkaListener(
        topics = "${kafka.topic.post-created}",
        groupId = "${kafka.group.timeline-updater}"
    )
    public void consumePostCreatedEvent(
            @Payload PostEvent event,
            @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_KEY) String key) {
            
        log.info("Consuming post event: {} with key: {}", event, key);
        
        // Process the event by updating timelines
        timelineService.addPostToFollowerTimelines(
            event.getUserId(),
            event.getPostId()
        );
    }
}
```

**Performance & Scaling**
- Horizontal scaling of producers and consumers.
- Partitioning by user ID ensures ordered processing per user.
- Consumer groups for parallel processing.

**Pitfalls & Best Practices**
- **Event Schema Evolution**: Changing event structure can break consumers.
- **Ordering Guarantees**: Only within partitions, not globally.
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Handle failed message processing.
- Use schema registry for event compatibility.
- Implement idempotent consumers to handle duplicate events.
- Monitor consumer lag to detect processing bottlenecks.

### Search & Indexing (Elasticsearch)

**Concept & Principles**
- Full-text search and indexing.
- Advanced query capabilities (fuzzy matching, filtering, aggregations).
- Distributed architecture for scalability.

**Real-World Usage**
- Indexing posts for keyword, hashtag, and user mention searches.
- Supporting typeahead search suggestions.
- Filtering search results by time, engagement, or relevance.

**Java Example (Spring Data Elasticsearch)**

```java
// Document model
@Document(indexName = "posts")
public class PostDocument {
    
    @Id
    private String id;
    
    @Field(type = FieldType.Long)
    private Long userId;
    
    @Field(type = FieldType.Text, analyzer = "standard")
    private String content;
    
    @Field(type = FieldType.Date)
    private Date createdAt;
    
    @Field(type = FieldType.Keyword)
    private List<String> hashtags;
    
    @Field(type = FieldType.Keyword)
    private List<String> mentions;
    
    // getters, setters, etc.
}

// Repository interface
public interface PostSearchRepository extends ElasticsearchRepository<PostDocument, String> {
    
    List<PostDocument> findByContentContaining(String keyword, Pageable pageable);
    
    List<PostDocument> findByHashtagsIn(List<String> hashtags, Pageable pageable);
    
    // Custom query methods
    @Query("{\"bool\": {\"must\": [{\"match\": {\"content\": \"?0\"}}], \"filter\": [{\"terms\": {\"hashtags\": ?1}}]}}")
    List<PostDocument> findByContentAndHashtags(String content, List<String> hashtags, Pageable pageable);
}

// Service implementation
@Service
public class SearchService {
    
    @Autowired
    private PostSearchRepository repository;
    
    public List<PostDocument> searchPosts(String query, List<String> hashtags, int page, int size) {
        Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(page, size, Sort.by(Sort.Direction.DESC, "createdAt"));
        
        if (hashtags != null && !hashtags.isEmpty()) {
            return repository.findByContentAndHashtags(query, hashtags, pageable);
        } else {
            return repository.findByContentContaining(query, pageable);
        }
    }
    
    // Additional search methods
}
```

**Performance & Scaling**
- Sharding indices across multiple nodes.
- Separate read and write clusters for high throughput.
- Document routing to optimize search locality.

**Pitfalls & Best Practices**
- **Index Explosion**: Too many small indices create overhead.
- **Mapping Explosions**: Dynamic mapping with unbounded fields.
- **Query Complexity**: Inefficient queries can cause performance issues.
- Define explicit mappings rather than relying on dynamic mapping.
- Use time-based indices for efficient data aging and deletion.
- Implement bulk indexing for high-volume updates.

### Load Balancing & Edge Caching

**Concept & Principles**
- Distributing traffic across multiple service instances.
- Caching static and semi-static content at the edge.
- Geographic distribution for lower latency.

**Real-World Usage**
- Load balancing requests across API servers.
- CDN caching for media, static assets, and public profile pages.
- Edge computing for personalized content assembly.

**Implementation Example (Nginx Configuration)**

```nginx
upstream timeline_service {
    hash $request_uri consistent;
    server timeline-service-1:8080;
    server timeline-service-2:8080;
    server timeline-service-3:8080;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    
    # Serve static assets via CDN
    location /static/ {
        proxy_pass https://cdn-endpoint.cloudfront.net;
        expires 1d;
    }
    
    # Pass API requests to backend services
    location /api/timeline/ {
        proxy_pass http://timeline_service;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        
        # Cache public timelines
        proxy_cache timeline_cache;
        proxy_cache_valid 200 1m;
        proxy_cache_key "$request_uri|$cookie_user";
        proxy_cache_bypass $cookie_nocache;
    }
    
    # Other location blocks for different services
}
```

**Performance & Scaling**
- Geographic DNS routing to direct users to closest data centers.
- Edge caching reduces origin server load and improves latency.
- Consistent hashing for load balancer stability during scaling events.

**Pitfalls & Best Practices**
- **Cache Invalidation**: Difficult to invalidate specific cached content.
- **Sticky Sessions**: May cause uneven load distribution.
- **Cold Cache**: New instances suffer from poor performance until cache warms.
- Implement cache control headers for optimal caching.
- Use staggered cache expiration to prevent mass expiration.
- Configure health checks for proper load balancer failover.

### Real-time Analytics

**Concept & Principles**
- Stream processing for real-time insights.
- Near real-time aggregations and metrics.
- Trending detection algorithms.

**Real-World Usage**
- Detecting trending hashtags and topics.
- Monitoring engagement metrics (views, likes, retweets).
- User behavior analysis for recommendation.

**Java Example (Kafka Streams)**

```java
@Component
public class TrendingTopicsProcessor {

    @Autowired
    private KafkaStreams kafkaStreams;
    
    @PostConstruct
    public void startProcessing() {
        StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
        
        // Read post creation events
        KStream<String, PostEvent> postEvents = builder.stream(
            "post-created",
            Consumed.with(Serdes.String(), new JsonSerde<>(PostEvent.class))
        );
        
        // Extract hashtags from posts
        KStream<String, String> hashtags = postEvents
            .flatMapValues(post -> extractHashtags(post.getContent()))
            .map((key, hashtag) -> new KeyValue<>(hashtag, hashtag));
        
        // Count hashtags within a hopping time window
        KTable<Windowed<String>, Long> hashtagCounts = hashtags
            .groupByKey()
            .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(10)).advanceBy(Duration.ofMinutes(1)))
            .count();
        
        // Find trending hashtags (those with significant count increases)
        KStream<String, TrendingHashtag> trendingHashtags = hashtagCounts
            .toStream()
            .map((windowedHashtag, count) -> {
                String hashtag = windowedHashtag.key();
                long previousCount = getPreviousCount(hashtag);
                double growth = calculateGrowthRate(count, previousCount);
                
                return new KeyValue<>(
                    hashtag,
                    new TrendingHashtag(hashtag, count, growth, windowedHashtag.window().endTime())
                );
            })
            .filter((hashtag, trending) -> trending.getGrowthRate() > TRENDING_THRESHOLD);
        
        // Publish trending hashtags to output topic
        trendingHashtags.to(
            "trending-hashtags",
            Produced.with(Serdes.String(), new JsonSerde<>(TrendingHashtag.class))
        );
        
        // Build and start the topology
        Topology topology = builder.build();
        kafkaStreams.start();
    }
    
    // Helper methods for extracting hashtags and calculating growth
}
```

**Performance & Scaling**
- Parallel processing using Kafka Streams partitioning.
- Windowed aggregations for time-based trends.
- State stores for efficient local state management.

**Pitfalls & Best Practices**
- **Data Skew**: Popular topics can create hot partitions.
- **Window Management**: Carefully balance window size vs. freshness.
- **State Store Growth**: Unbounded growth can consume resources.
- Implement proper compaction and cleanup policies.
- Use probabilistic data structures (HyperLogLog) for large-scale counting.
- Design for both real-time and batch processing paths.

## Performance & Scalability Considerations

1. **Read vs. Write Optimization**:  
   News feeds are read-heavy (10:1 or higher read-to-write ratio). Design favors read performance over write throughput.

2. **Horizontal Scaling**:  
   All components (services, databases, caches) must scale horizontally to handle growth.

3. **Database Sharding**:  
   Partition data by user ID to distribute load and avoid hotspots.

4. **Caching Strategy**:  
   Multi-level caching (CDN, Redis, application) to minimize database access.

5. **Fan-out Optimization**:  
   Hybrid push/pull model to handle celebrity users efficiently.

6. **Asynchronous Processing**:  
   Non-critical operations (search indexing, analytics) handled asynchronously.

7. **Intelligent Resource Allocation**:  
   Focus resources on active users; handle inactive accounts more efficiently.

8. **Cold Start Mitigation**:  
   Warm caches for anticipated traffic spikes (major events, promotions).

9. **Regional Deployment**:  
   Deploy in multiple regions to reduce latency for global user base.

10. **Content Delivery Optimization**:  
    CDN for static assets, media files, and possibly public timeline content.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

1. **Hot User Problem**:  
   Celebrity users with millions of followers create fan-out bottlenecks. Solution: Hybrid push/pull model.

2. **Cache Invalidation**:  
   Ensuring timeline caches reflect latest changes. Solution: Time-based expiration + event-based invalidation.

3. **Data Consistency**:  
   Users seeing different timelines on different devices. Solution: Strong consistency for writes, consistent hashing for reads.

4. **Cold Cache Problem**:  
   New service instances have empty caches. Solution: Warm-up procedures, consistent hashing in load balancing.

5. **Feed Duplicates or Gaps**:  
   Timeline updates may be processed out of order. Solution: Idempotent operations, logical timestamps.

6. **Database Hotspots**:  
   Uneven load on database shards. Solution: Proper shard key selection, read replicas.

7. **Thundering Herd**:  
   Simultaneous cache expiration causing overload. Solution: Jittered expiration times, request coalescing.

8. **Resource Exhaustion**:  
   Unbounded timeline growth. Solution: Timeline size limits, time-windowed data.

9. **Race Conditions**:  
   Concurrent updates to same data (like counters). Solution: Atomic operations, distributed locks.

10. **Visibility Lag**:  
    Delay between posting and timeline visibility. Solution: Optimistic timeline updates, clear loading states in UI.

## Best Practices & Maintenance

1. **Automated Deployment Pipeline**:  
   CI/CD for consistent, reliable deployments with minimal downtime.

2. **Observability**:  
   Comprehensive logging, metrics, and distributed tracing (ELK stack, Prometheus, Jaeger).

3. **Graceful Degradation**:  
   Design services to function with limited capability when dependencies fail.

4. **Rate Limiting**:  
   Protect services from abuse and ensure fair resource allocation.

5. **Data Partitioning Strategy**:  
   Plan for growth with a sharding strategy that minimizes resharding needs.

6. **Regular Performance Testing**:  
   Load testing to identify bottlenecks before they impact users.

7. **Dark Launches**:  
   Roll out new features to small subsets of users to detect issues early.

8. **Database Maintenance**:  
   Regular compaction, indexing optimization, and schema evolution planning.

9. **Caching Policies**:  
   Clear TTL strategies, eviction policies, and replication for resilience.

10. **Disaster Recovery**:  
    Regular backups, cross-region replication, and recovery practice drills.
